Title: Embedded Morgan Fingerprints
Description: Embedded version of Morgan binary Fingerprints (eMFP) that 
  preserves the key structural information of the encoded molecule. The 
  implementation of eMFP offers an improved data representation that mitigates 
  the risk of overfitting while enhancing model performance.
